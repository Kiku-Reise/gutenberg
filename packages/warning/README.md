# Warning

Utility for warning messages to the console based on a passed condition.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @wordpress/warning --save
```

This is recommended to use in conjunction with [`babel-plugin-dev-expression`](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/babel-plugin-dev-expression) so your warning messages won't end up in your production bundle.

_This package assumes that your code will run in an **ES2015+** environment. If you're using an environment that has limited or no support for ES2015+ such as lower versions of IE then using [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill) will add support for these methods. Learn more about it in [Babel docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/caveats)._
